# SelMap â€” Safe Nmap Results Manager (Full)

SelMap is a local, safe tool that parses Nmap output files and helps you manage, edit, and report results.
**IMPORTANT:** SelMap NEVER performs network scanning. It only parses user-supplied Nmap outputs and local vulnerability DB files.

## Features
- Parse `.gnmap` and `.xml` Nmap outputs
- Editable results table and bulk rename of services
- Basic heuristic risk scoring
- Local CVE matching (user-provided JSON/CSV)
- Export CSV / JSON / GNMAP-like text
- Generate PDF and plain text reports
